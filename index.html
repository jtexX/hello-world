  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  
<p>This is a small sample. Maybe it'll grow... we'll see.</p>
<h2>I'm Back!</h2> 
<p class="date"> Jan 31st, 2021</p>
<p>I've learned a little more about HTML5 and I'm honestly <em>super excited</em> to learn more. 
  So I'm going to try and show you what I can do below</p>
<h3>Look! a different heading</h3>
<p>I learned that there are 6 different headings to choose from to help organize your site</p>
<h6>Did I mention that you can do this?</h6>
<p>Ok let's get back on track here I also learned how to make links to other sites so here's a link to a sicc Apex edit I made</p>
  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHOmyUMsXVE> <em>Sicc Edit</em> </a> 
<p>did you enjoy it... did you actually watch it? just kidding, I just needed to make sure it actually worked.</p>
<h2>Ok so next</h2>
<p>I'm going to write a small article on why LED lights make your room the <em>hang out (dorm)room</em> </p>  
<article>
  <h2>To LED or not To LED</h2>
  <p>To answer the question, definitely <strong>To LED</strong>, I mean why wouldn't you want to have nice lighting that you can manipulate to your heart's content.
    I mean really. However a lot of people make the common mistake of ordering ordinary LEDs without realizing one crucial difference... <em>RGB</em>. That's the
    magic word right there- <strong>R G B</strong>. RGB essentially means that the lights can change colors, and 
    that matters. By being able to control the colors of the lights, you can harness the <strong>vibes</strong>. The best is buying 2 sets of <em>RGB LEDs,</em>
    and mixing different colors together to enhance said <strong>vibe</strong>. If you want to get really boujee you can buy the ones that change to music but who has
    that kind of money to spend.</p>
  <p>So now you have the atmosphere, so go and <strong>SHOW IT OFF</strong>. Invite friends over! invite neighbors over, if you have the opportunity to show
    your homies, take it! Reel people into the, as the young folk say, <q> <em>immaculate vibes</em> </q> of what is soon going to be: <strong>The Legendary Hangout Room.</strong>
    The more time you have people spend in your room, the more time they have to appreciate the beauty of lighting that you have created. Granted you have nice decorations,
    good music, seating, and all that other stuff, your room will become the hangout room. Now if you don't want your room to be the hang out room but still want to enjoy
    luxury lighting, follow the simple technique of literally not inviting anyone over unless you actually want their company!. So at the end of the day, buy those LEDs,
    even if its for yourself because, the lighting do be going crazy.</p>

<p>Well, I'm glad that worked. I hope you've also noticed that I've managed to change the font a little bit too. Been working on a little bit of css but it's a little tricky.</p>
