<h1>Hello, World!</h1> 

<p>This is a small sample. Maybe it'll grow... we'll see.</p>
<h1>I'm Back!</h1>

<p>I've learned a little more about HTML5 and I'm honestly <em>super excited</em> to learn more. 
  So I'm going to try and show you what I can do below</p>
<h2>Look! a different heading</h2>
<p>I learned that there are 6 different headings to choose from to help organize your site</p>
<h6>Did I mention that you can do this?</h6>
<p>Ok let's get back on track here I also learned how to make links to other sites so here's a link to a sicc Apex edit I made</p>
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHOmyUMsXVE <h1>Sicc Edit</h1> </a>
<p>did you enjoy it... did you actually watch it? just kidding, I just needed to make sure it actually worked.</p>
<h1>Ok so next</h1>
<p>I'm going to write a small article on why LED lights make your room the <em>hang out (dorm)room</em> </p>  
<article>
  <h1>To LED or not To LED</h1>
  <p>To answer the question, definitely <strong>To LED</strong>, I mean why wouldn't you want to have nice lighting that you can manipulate to your heart's content.
    I mean really. However a lot of people make the common mistake of ordering ordinary LEDs without realizing one crucial difference... <em>RGB</em>. That's the
    magic word right there- <strong>R G B</strong>. RGB essentially means that the lights can change colors, and 
    that matters. By being able to control the colors of the lights, you can harness the <strong>vibes</strong>. The best is buying 2 sets of <em>RGB LEDs,</em>
    and mixing different colors together to enhance said <strong>vibe</strong>. If you want to get really boujee you can buy the ones that change to music but who has
    that kind of money to spend.</p>
  <p>So now you have the atmosphere, so go and <strong>SHOW IT OFF</strong>. Invite friends over! invite neighbors over, if you have the opportunity to show
    your homies, take it! Reel people into the, as the young folk say, <q> <em>"immaculate"</em> </q>
